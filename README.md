# Welcome to 42

Hi! Here is all my work at [42 Sillicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/) and [42 Paris](https://www.42.fr/). Most of the projects are in C.
# Configuration
I always use my static library [libft_g](/libft_g).
I also use my [Dockerfile](/docker_config/Dockerfile) to have a Linux environment.
